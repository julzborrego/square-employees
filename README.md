Sample app for Square Interview

1.Your Focus Areas. What area(s) did you focus on when working on the project? The architecture and data flow? The UI? Something else? Please note what you think best exhibits your skills and areas of expertise.

I focused on it all! Wanted to display my skills as a full stack developer. "if you put water in the cup it becomes the cup" -Bruce Lee-

2.Copied-in code or copied-in dependencies. We’re obviously looking to evaluate your skills as an engineer! As such, please tell us which code you’ve copied into your project so we can distinguish between code written for this project, versus code written at another time, or by others (if you’re just referencing a dependency via a dependency manager, no need to call it out here).

So mostly everything from the Util classes(LayoutUtils, TestUtils) was copied in, everything else I wrote. Notable dependencies used in this app include Koin, Retrofit, Picasso, Mockito Kotlin.

3.Tablet / phone focus. If you focused on one or the other of tablet or phone, please let us know which one.

I focused on my phone but it should look great on tablet as well.

Long pressing on a card will alternate from users image and bio. 
Dark theme enabled.
